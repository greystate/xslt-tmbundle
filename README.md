# XSLT.tmbundle

This my own tried and tested, tweaked and twisted **XSLT bundle** for **[TextMate 2][TM2]**.

[TM2]: http://macromates.com/

## Installation

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles/
	git clone git://github.com/greystate/xslt-tmbundle XSLT.tmbundle

## Notes

* Some commands still refer to scripts on my local drive, so won't work. Hopefully I'll be able to fix those along the way.
